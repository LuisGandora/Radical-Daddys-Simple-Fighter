# Radical-Daddys-Simple-Fighter
This is my First Unity 2D Fighter
Apart from just also using Unity, I also had to expand my knowledge in various art software such as blender, Aesprite, Bosca Ceoil, and Davinci.

This is also part of my 12 month Game Dev Challenge where I attempt to make a game every month.

As for the game, you can only play it on one computer, would recommend using multiple keyboards.

Since this is my first attempt at creating a 2D Fighter, I did have to play around with the Input Manager in Unity, if you decompiled the code though it would be pretty messy. Instead of invoking functions of the fighters on button presses I opted to scan for inputs via character scripts instead.

It was less proficient but provided me a solution to my issue of multiple characters temporarily for this month.


I also had the opportunity to use blender for Pixel Art for interesting designs. Using the combined plugins of both armature and NCUpaint.


The most important lesson however is that I cannot underestimate the dev process of a game as this. The biggest obstacle that came from this project is when I ran straightfirst into scripting without considering the structure of the entire game.

Anyways, those are my notes enjoy my game!
